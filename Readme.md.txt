To successfully run this on localhost a server is needed. A server such as WAMP or XAMPP can be used. 
For XAMPP, add the file to the xampp folder in C:/ drive. 
To do this, open C:/ drive and search for XAMPP, inside the XAMPP folder search for htdocs and paste this folder inside it. 

Turn XAMPP Apache and MYSQL on and using a browser, type localhost/Task 2 (which is the folder name).
